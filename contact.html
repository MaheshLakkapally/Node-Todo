<p>hello Node jsProperties validation is useful way to force correct usage of your components. This will help you during development to avoid future bugs and problems once your app become larger. It also makes code more readable since you can see how each component should be used.

Validating Props
In this example we are creating App component with all the props that we need. App.propTypes is used for props validation. If some of the props aren't using correct type that we assigned, we will get console warning. After we specified validation patterns, we are setting App.defaultProps.
